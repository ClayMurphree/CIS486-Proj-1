        AS A professor
        I WANT to see faces with names of students
        SO THAT I can see the people who are a part of the team

        Minimum Acceptance Criteria: Member photos are visible from webpage and visibly correspond with names of members in all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

        Work Process:
        1) Collect Pictures from Google Sheets at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d89zcUC3Luifdx4CeV-Ofzmk1HUhjlza4YjqIs7iSFs/edit#gid=2104227102
        2) Compress using https://tinypng.com/
        3) Rename for Json. Using camel case, first initial, last name, and lowercase file extension. Example: mPitt.jpg
        4) Reformat for UI (590px wide * 800px height).
        4) Upload to Github repo (master%2Fimg)

        Testing Procedures:
        1) Navigate to webpage (barrycumbie.com)
        2) Navigate to Bios (List of Class Members tab)
        3) Are pictures visible in all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop)? Placeholder picture may appear for some names. Take screenshots to confirm results and post in comments of this card. Take at least 3 (one for each screen size: full-size, medium size/tablet, and small/phone-size)
        4) Do non-placeholder pictures correspond with name in page schema?

        If YES to all, the test passes.
