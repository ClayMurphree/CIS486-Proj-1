<h2> University of North Alabama Universal Calendar </h2>
<p align ="center">
 
<font color="white"> As students of the University of North Alabama, we 
saw a need for an all-in-one calendar. There is no resource on UNAâ€™s website
 that collectively shows all events, dates, and deadlines in one place for 
 students to view. We decided to collect and display all calendar events divided
 into categories including: Registration, Academics, Student Clubs and Organizations,
 Sports, and Miscellaneous events. We decided that these calendars, although divided 
 and somewhat organized, still cover a broad range of categories. There was still a 
 need to further categorize these students events beyond the basic 5 categories that 
 we picked out. We then created smaller, more specific calendar categories to accurately 
 pinpoint a list of events that the student is looking for.
